<h4>Here we go for the second part of Linux Fundamentals</h4>

We are going to deploy a Linux VM on browser to try some cool stuff

For instance we learned this command to connect to another machine via internet with ```ssh```

```ssh tryhackme@10.10.238.28```

If we want to list stuff we will execute this command ```ls``` , but if we want to see even hidden files, we do

```ls -a``` The ```-a``` is for "all"

If we execute ```ls --help``` it will show us what we can do with ```ls``` command

<h2>More commands</h2>

```touch``` Create file

```mkdir``` Create folder

```cp``` Copy a file or folder

```mv``` Move a file or folder

```rm``` Remove a file or folder

```file``` Determine the type of a file
